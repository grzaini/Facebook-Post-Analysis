### Facebook Post Analysis

In this work I have crawled a journalist's Facebook posts by his permission. He usually posts almost all news of the Faryab province, of the north provinces of Afghanistan. These posts contain all news of the province from a hospital surgery being operated on a patient to the significant political aspect on-going in the community. 

I have shown how much he has posted daily and how many of his posts are liked and commented on. There is also shown how the positive and negative content they had. It can be used for psychological purposes while it indicates how much this society is filled with happiness or sorrow and sadness. The positive and negative content is measured based on a persian dataset, where all these two types of words are gathered and used for projects. The followings show are from two - positive and negative - words.

Since this work was done to promote my academic grade in the Faryab University, where I was working, the report is written in Persian language.
